MR TILLY HAD ONLY THE BRIEFEST MOMENT FOR REFLECTION WHEN AS HE SLIPPED AND FELL ON THE GREASY WOOD PAVEMENT AT HYDE PARK CORNER WHICH HE WAS CROSSING AT A SMART TROT HE SAW THE HUGE TRACTION ENGINE WITH ITS GROOVED PONDEROUS WHEELS TOWERING HIGH ABOVE HIM OH DEAR OH DEAR HE SAID PETULANTLY IT WILL CERTAINLY CRUSH ME QUITE FLAT AND I SHANT BE ABLE TO BE AT MRS CUMBERBATCHS SÉANCE MOST PROVOKING A OW THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH WHEN THE FIRST HALF OF HIS HORRID ANTICIPATIONS WAS THOROUGHLY FULFILLED THE HEAVY WHEELS PASSED OVER HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FLATTENED HIM COMPLETELY OUT THEN THE DRIVER TOO LATE REVERSED HIS ENGINE AND PASSED OVER HIM AGAIN AND FINALLY LOST HIS HEAD WHISTLED LOUDLY AND STOPPED THE POLICEMAN ON DUTY AT THE CORNER TURNED QUITE FAINT AT THE SIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE BUT PRESENTLY RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO HOLD UP THE TRAFFIC AND RAN TO SEE WHAT ON EARTH COULD BE DONE IT WAS ALL SO MUCH UP WITH MR TILLY THAT THE ONLY THING POSSIBLE WAS TO GET THE HYSTERICAL ENGINE DRIVER TO MOVE CLEAR THEN THE AMBULANCE FROM THE HOSPITAL WAS SENT FOR AND MR TILLYS REMAINS DETACHED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY FROM THE ROAD SO FIRMLY HAD THEY BEEN PRESSED INTO IT WERE REVERENTLY CARRIED AWAY INTO THE MORTUARY MR TILLY DURING THIS HAD EXPERIENCED ONE MOMENTS EXCRUCIATING PAIN RESEMBLING THE SEVEREST NEURALGIA AS HIS HEAD WAS GROUND BENEATH THE WHEEL BUT ALMOST BEFORE HE REALISED IT THE PAIN WAS PAST AND HE FOUND HIMSELF STILL RATHER DAZED FLOATING OR STANDING HE DID NO KNOW WHICH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THERE HAD BEEN NO BREAK IN HIS CONSCIOUSNESS HE PERFECTLY RECOLLECTED SLIPPING AND WONDERED HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF HE SAW THE ARRESTED TRAFFIC THE POLICEMAN WITH WHITE WAN FACE MAKING SUGGESTIONS TO THE GIBBERING ENGINE DRIVER AND HE RECEIVED THE VERY PUZZLING IMPRESSION THAT THE TRACTION ENGINE WAS ALL MIXED UP WITH HIM HE HAD A SENSATION OF RED HOT COALS AND BOILING WATER AND RIVETS ALL AROUND HIM BUT YET NO FEELING OF SCALDING OR BURNING OR CONFINEMENT HE WAS ON THE CONTRARY EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE AND HAD THE MOST PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF BUOYANCY AND FREEDOM THEN THE ENGINE PUFFED AND THE WHEELS WENT ROUND AND IMMEDIATELY TO HIS IMMENSE SURPRISE HE PERCEIVED HIS OWN CRUSHED REMAINS FLAT AS A BISCUIT LYING ON THE ROADWAY HE IDENTIFIED THEM FOR CERTAIN BY HIS CLOTHES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MORNING AND ONE PATENT LEATHER BOOT WHICH HAD ESCAPED DEMOLITION BUT WHAT ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED HE SAID HERE AM I AND YET THAT POOR PRESSED FLOWER OF ARMS AND LEGS IS ME OR RATHER I ALSO AND HOW TERRIBLY UPSET THE DRIVER LOOKS WHY I DO BELIEVE THAT IVE BEEN RUN OVER IT DID HURT FOR A MOMENT NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT MY GOOD MAN WHERE ARE YOU SHOVING TO DONT YOU SEE ME HE ADDRESSED THESE TWO QUESTIONS TO THE POLICEMAN WHO APPEARED TO WALK RIGHT THROUGH HIM BUT THE MAN TOOK NO NOTICE AND CALMLY CAME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT SEE HIM OR APPREHEND HIM IN ANY WAY MR TILLY WAS STILL FEELING RATHER AT SEA AMID THESE UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES AND THERE BEGAN TO STEAL INTO HIS MIND A GLIMPSE OF THE FACT WHICH WAS SO OBVIOUS TO THE CROWD WHICH FORMED AN INTERESTED BUT RESPECTFUL RING ROUND HIS BODY MEN STOOD WITH BARED HEADS WOMEN SCREAMED AND LOOKED AWAY AND LOOKED BACK AGAIN I REALLY BELIEVE IM DEAD HE SAID THATS THE ONLY HYPOTHESIS WHICH WILL COVER THE FACTS BUT I MUST FEEL MORE CERTAIN OF IT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING AH HERE THEY COME WITH THE AMBULANCE TO LOOK AT ME I MUST BE TERRIBLY HURT AND YET I DONT FEEL HURT I SHOULD FEEL HURT SURELY IF I WAS HURT I MUST BE DEAD CERTAINLY IT SEEMED THE ONLY THING FOR HIM TO BE BUT HE WAS FAR FROM REALISING IT YET A LANE HAD BEEN MADE THROUGH THE CROWD FOR THE STRETCHER BEARERS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF WINCING WHEN THEY BEGAN TO DETACH HIM FROM THE ROAD OH DO TAKE CARE HE SAID THATS THE SCIATIC NERVE PROTRUDING THERE SURELY ISNT IT A OW NO IT DIDNT HURT AFTER ALL MY NEW CLOTHES TOO I PUT THEM ON TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT BAD LUCK NOW YOURE HOLDING MY LEG UPSIDE DOWN OF COURSE ALL MY MONEY COMES OUT OF MY TROUSER POCKET AND THERES MY TICKET FOR THE SÉANCE I MUST HAVE THAT I MAY USE IT AFTER ALL HE TWEAKED IT OUT OF THE FINGERS OF THE MAN WHO HAD PICKED IT UP AND LAUGHED TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF AMAZEMENT ON HIS FACE AS THE CARD SUDDENLY VANISHED THAT GAVE HIM SOMETHING FRESH TO THINK ABOUT AND HE PONDERED FOR A MOMENT OVER SOME TOUCH OF ASSOCIATION SET UP BY IT I HAVE IT HE THOUGHT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MOMENT I CAME INTO CONNECTION WITH THAT CARD IT BECAME INVISIBLE IM INVISIBLE MYSELF OF COURSE TO THE GROSSER SENSE AND EVERYTHING I HOLD BECOMES INVISIBLE MOST INTERESTING THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE SUDDEN APPEARANCES OF SMALL OBJECTS AT A SÉANCE THE SPIRIT HAS BEEN HOLDING THEM AND AS LONG AS HE HOLDS THEM THEY ARE INVISIBLE THEN HE LETS GO AND THERES THE FLOWER OR THE SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPH ON THE TABLE IT ACCOUNTS TOO FOR THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCES OF SUCH OBJECTS THE SPIRIT HAS TAKEN THEM THOUGH THE SCOFFERS SAY THAT THE MEDIUM HAS SECRETED THEM ABOUT HIS PERSON IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN SEARCHED HE SOMETIMES APPEARS TO HAVE DONE SO BUT AFTER ALL THAT MAY BE A JOKE ON THE PART OF THE SPIRIT NOW WHAT AM I TO DO WITH MYSELF LET ME SEE THERES THE CLOCK ITS JUST HALF PAST TEN ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED IN A FEW MINUTES FOR IT WAS A QUARTER PAST WHEN I LEFT MY HOUSE HALF PAST TEN NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY I USED TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT BUT NOW IT SEEMS NONSENSE TEN WHAT HOURS IS IT WHATS AN HOUR THIS WAS VERY PUZZLING HE FELT THAT HE USED TO KNOW WHAT AN HOUR AND A MINUTE MEANT BUT THE PERCEPTION OF THAT NATURALLY ENOUGH HAD CEASED WITH HIS EMERGENCE FROM TIME AND SPACE INTO ETERNITY THE CONCEPTION OF TIME WAS LIKE SOME MEMORY WHICH REFUSING TO RECORD ITSELF ON THE CONSCIOUSNESS LIES PERDU IN SOME DARK CORNER OF THE BRAIN LAUGHING AT THE EFFORTS OF THE OWNER TO FERRET IT OUT WHILE HE STILL INTERROGATED HIS MIND OVER THIS LAPSED PERCEPTION HE FOUND THAT SPACE AS WELL AS TIME HAD SIMILARLY GROWN OBSOLETE FOR HIM FOR HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND MISS IDA SOULSBY WHO HE KNEW WAS TO BE PRESENT AT THE SÉANCE FOR WHICH HE WAS BOUND HURRYING WITH BIRD LIKE STEPS DOWN THE PAVEMENT OPPOSITE FORGETTING FOR THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS A DISEMBODIED SPIRIT HE MADE THE EFFORT OF WILL WHICH IN HIS PAST HUMAN EXISTENCE WOULD HAVE SET HIS LEGS IN PURSUIT OF HER AND FOUND THAT THE EFFORT OF WILL ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO PLACE HIM AT HER SIDE MY DEAR MISS SOULSBY HE SAID I WAS ON MY WAY TO MRS CUMBERBATCHS HOUSE WHEN I WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND KILLED IT WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT A MOMENTS HEADACHE SO FAR HIS NATURAL VOLUBILITY HAD CARRIED HIM BEFORE HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE WAS INVISIBLE AND INAUDIBLE TO THOSE STILL CLOSED IN BY THE MUDDY VESTURE OF DECAY AND STOPPED SHORT BUT THOUGH IT WAS CLEAR THAT WHAT HE SAID WAS INAUDIBLE TO MISS SOULSBYS RATHER LARGE INTELLIGENT LOOKING EARS IT SEEMED THAT SOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS PRESENCE WAS CONVEYED TO HER FINER SENSE FOR SHE LOOKED SUDDENLY STARTLED A FLUSH ROSE TO HER FACE AND HE HEARD HER MURMUR VERY ODD I WONDER WHY I RECEIVED SO VIVID AN IMPRESSION OF DEAR TEDDY THAT GAVE MR TILLY A PLEASANT SHOCK HE HAD LONG ADMIRED THE LADY AND HERE SHE WAS ALLUDING TO HIM IN HER SUPPOSED PRIVACY AS DEAR TEDDY THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A MOMENTARY REGRET THAT HE HAD BEEN KILLED HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN POSSESSED OF THIS INFORMATION BEFORE AND HAVE PURSUED THE PRIMROSE PATH OF DALLIANCE DOWN WHICH IT SEEMED TO LEAD HIS INTENTIONS OF COURSE WOULD AS ALWAYS HAVE BEEN STRICTLY HONOURABLE THE PATH OF DALLIANCE WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED THEM BOTH IF SHE CONSENTED TO THE ALTAR WHERE THE PRIMROSES WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCHANGED FOR ORANGE BLOSSOM BUT HIS REGRET WAS QUITE SHORT LIVED THOUGH THE ALTAR SEEMED INACCESSIBLE THE PRIMROSE PATH MIGHT STILL BE OPEN FOR MANY OF THE SPIRIT CIRCLE IN WHICH HE LIVED WERE ON MOST AFFECTIONATE TERMS WITH THEIR SPIRITUAL GUIDES AND FRIENDS WHO LIKE HIMSELF HAD PASSED OVER FROM A HUMAN POINT OF VIEW THESE INNOCENT AND EVEN ELEVATING FLIRTATIONS HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM RATHER BLOODLESS BUT NOW LOOKING ON THEM FROM THE FAR SIDE HE SAW HOW CHARMING THEY WERE FOR THEY GAVE HIM THE SENSE OF STILL HAVING A PLACE AND AN IDENTITY IN THE WORLD HE HAD JUST QUITTED HE PRESSED MISS IDAS HAND OR RATHER PUT HIMSELF INTO THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF SO DOING AND COULD VAGUELY FEEL THAT IT HAD SOME HINT OF WARMTH AND SOLIDITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS GRATIFYING FOR IT SHOWED THAT THOUGH HE HAD PASSED OUT OF THE MATERIAL PLANE HE COULD STILL BE IN TOUCH WITH IT STILL MORE GRATIFYING WAS IT TO OBSERVE THAT A PLEASED AND SECRET SMILE OVERSPREAD MISS IDAS FINE FEATURES AS HE GAVE THIS TOKEN OF HIS PRESENCE PERHAPS SHE ONLY SMILED AT HER OWN THOUGHTS BUT IN ANY CASE IT WAS HE WHO HAD INSPIRED THEM ENCOURAGED BY THIS HE INDULGED IN A SLIGHTLY MORE INTIMATE TOKEN OF AFFECTION AND PERMITTED HIMSELF A RESPECTFUL SALUTE AND SAW THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR FOR SHE SAID TO HERSELF HUSH HUSH AND QUICKENED HER PACE AS IF TO LEAVE THESE AMOROUS THOUGHTS BEHIND HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO ADJUST HIMSELF TO THE NEW CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE WOULD NOW LIVE OR AT ANY RATE WAS GETTING SOME SORT OF INKLING AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TIME EXISTED NO MORE FOR HIM NOR YET DID SPACE SINCE THE WISH TO BE AT MISS IDAS SIDE HAD INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED HIM THERE AND WITH A VIEW TO TESTING THIS FURTHER HE WISHED HIMSELF BACK IN HIS FLAT AS SWIFTLY AS THE CHANGE OF SCENE IN A CINEMATOGRAPH SHOW HE FOUND HIMSELF THERE AND PERCEIVED THAT THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH MUST HAVE REACHED HIS SERVANTS FOR HIS COOK AND PARLOUR MAID WITH EXCITED FACES WERE TALKING OVER THE EVENT POOR LITTLE GENTLEMAN SAID HIS COOK IT SEEMS A SHAME IT DOES HE NEVER HURT A FLY AND TO THINK OF ONE OF THOSE GREAT ENGINES LAYING HIM OUT FLAT I HOPE THEYLL TAKE HIM TO THE CEMETERY FROM THE HOSPITAL I NEVER COULD BEAR A CORPSE IN THE HOUSE THE GREAT STRAPPING PARLOUR MAID TOSSED HER HEAD WELL IM NOT SURE THAT IT DOESNT SERVE HIM RIGHT SHE OBSERVED ALWAYS MESSING ABOUT WITH SPIRITS HE WAS AND THE KNOCKINGS AND CONCERTINAS WAS AWFUL SOMETIMES WHEN IVE BEEN LAYING OUT SUPPER IN THE DINING ROOM NOW PERHAPS HELL COME HIMSELF AND VISIT THE REST OF THE LOONIES BUT IM SORRY ALL THE SAME A LESS TROUBLESOME LITTLE GENTLEMAN NEVER STEPPED ALWAYS PLEASANT TOO AND WAGES PAID TO THE DAY THESE REGRETFUL COMMENTS AND ENCOMIUMS WERE SOMETHING OF A SHOCK TO MR TILLY HE HAD IMAGINED THAT HIS EXCELLENT SERVANTS REGARDED HIM WITH A RESPECTFUL AFFECTION AS BEFITTED SOME SORT OF DEMIGOD AND THE ROLE OF THE POOR LITTLE GENTLEMAN WAS NOT AT ALL TO HIS MIND THIS REVELATION OF THEIR TRUE ESTIMATE OF HIM ALTHOUGH WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF HIM COULD NO LONGER HAVE THE SMALLEST SIGNIFICANCE IRRITATED HIM PROFOUNDLY I NEVER HEARD SUCH IMPERTINENCE HE SAID SO HE THOUGHT QUITE OUT LOUD AND STILL INTENSELY EARTH BOUND WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THAT THEY HAD NO PERCEPTION WHATEVER OF HIS PRESENCE HE RAISED HIS VOICE REPLETE WITH EXTREME IRONY AND ADDRESSED HIS COOK YOU MAY RESERVE YOUR CRITICISM ON MY CHARACTER FOR YOUR SAUCEPANS HE SAID THEY WILL NO DOUBT APPRECIATE THEM AS REGARDS THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY FUNERAL I HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR THEM IN MY WILL AND DO NOT PROPOSE TO CONSULT YOUR CONVENIENCE AT PRESENT LOR SAID MRS INGLIS I DECLARE I CAN ALMOST HEAR HIS VOICE POOR LITTLE FELLOW HUSKY IT WAS AS IF HE WOULD DO BETTER BY CLEARING HIS THROAT I SUPPOSE ID BEST BE MAKING A BLACK BOW TO MY CAP HIS LAWYERS AND WHAT NOT WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY MR TILLY HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH THIS SUGGESTION HE WAS IMMENSELY CONSCIOUS OF BEING QUITE ALIVE AND THE IDEA OF HIS SERVANTS BEHAVING AS IF HE WERE DEAD ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HIM WAS VERY VEXING HE WANTED TO GIVE THEM SOME STRIKING EVIDENCE OF HIS PRESENCE AND HIS ACTIVITY AND HE BANGED HIS HAND ANGRILY ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE FROM WHICH THE BREAKFAST EQUIPAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN CLEARED THREE TREMENDOUS BLOWS HE GAVE IT AND WAS REJOICED TO SEE THAT HIS PARLOUR MAID LOOKED STARTLED MRS INGLISS FACE REMAINED PERFECTLY PLACID WHY IF I DIDNT HEAR A SORT OF RAPPING SOUND SAID MISS TALTON WHERE DID IT COME FROM NONSENSE YOUVE THE JUMPS DEAR SAID MRS INGLIS PICKING UP A REMAINING RASHER OF BACON ON A FORK AND PUTTING IT INTO HER CAPACIOUS MOUTH MR TILLY WAS DELIGHTED AT MAKING ANY IMPRESSION AT ALL ON EITHER OF THESE IMPERCIPIENT FEMALES TALTON HE CALLED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WHY WHATS THAT SAID TALTON ALMOST HEAR HIS VOICE DO YOU SAY MRS INGLIS I DECLARE I DID HEAR HIS VOICE THEN A PACK O NONSENSE DEAR SAID MRS INGLIS PLACIDLY THATS A PRIME BIT OF BACON AND THERES A GOOD CUT OF IT LEFT WHY YOURE ALL OF A TREMBLE ITS YOUR IMAGINATION SUDDENLY IT STRUCK MR TILLY THAT HE MIGHT BE EMPLOYING HIMSELF MUCH BETTER THAN WITH SUCH EXTREME EXERTION MANAGING TO CONVEY SO SLIGHT A HINT OF HIS PRESENCE TO HIS PARLOUR MAID AND THAT THE SÉANCE AT THE HOUSE OF THE MEDIUM MRS CUMBERBATCH WOULD AFFORD HIM MUCH EASIER OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING THROUGH TO THE EARTH PLANE AGAIN HE GAVE A COUPLE MORE THUMPS TO THE TABLE AND WISHING HIMSELF AT MRS CUMBERBATCHS NEARLY A MILE AWAY SCARCELY HEARD THE FAINT SCREAM OF TALTON AT THE SOUND OF HIS BLOWS BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN WEST NORFOLK STREET HE KNEW THE HOUSE WELL AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF THE SÉANCES HE HAD SO OFTEN AND SO EAGERLY ATTENDED MRS CUMBERBATCH WHO HAD A LONG SPOON SHAPED FACE HAD ALREADY PULLED DOWN THE BLINDS LEAVING THE ROOM IN TOTAL DARKNESS EXCEPT FOR THE GLIMMER OF THE NIGHT LIGHT WHICH UNDER A SHADE OF RUBY GLASS STOOD ON THE CHIMNEYPIECE IN FRONT OF THE COLOURED PHOTOGRAPH OF CARDINAL NEWMAN ROUND THE TABLE WERE SEATED MISS IDA SOULSBY MR AND MRS MERIOTT WHO PAID THEIR GUINEAS AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK IN ORDER TO CONSULT THEIR SPIRITUAL GUIDE ABIBEL AND RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS ADVICE ABOUT THEIR INDIGESTION AND INVESTMENTS AND SIR JOHN PLAICE WHO WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN LEARNING THE DETAILS OF HIS PREVIOUS INCARNATION AS A CHALDEAN PRIEST COMPLETED THE CIRCLE HIS GUIDE WHO RESEALED TO HIM HIS SACERDOTAL CAREER WAS PLAYFULLY CALLED MESPOT NATURALLY MANY OTHER SPIRITS VISITED THEM FOR MISS SOULSBY HAD NO LESS THAN THREE GUIDES IN HER SPIRITUAL HOUSEHOLD SAPPHIRE SEMIRAMIS AND SWEET WILLIAM WHILE NAPOLEON AND PLATO WERE NOT INFREQUENT GUESTS CARDINAL NEWMAN TOO WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE AND THEY ENCOURAGED HIS PRESENCE BY THE SINGING IN UNISON OF LEAD KINDLY LIGHT HE COULD HARDLY EVER RESIST THAT MR TILLY OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT BY THE TABLE WHICH NO DOUBT HAD BEEN PLACED THERE FOR HIM AS HE ENTERED MRS CUMBERBATCH PEERED AT HER WATCH ELEVEN OCLOCK ALREADY SHE SAID AND MR TILLY IS NOT HERE YET I WONDER WHAT CAN HAVE KEPT HIM WHAT SHALL WE DO DEAR FRIENDS ABIBEL GETS VERY IMPATIENT SOMETIMES IF WE KEEP HIM WAITING MR AND MRS MERIOTT WERE GETTING IMPATIENT TOO FOR HE TERRIBLY WANTED TO ASK ABOUT MEXICAN OILS AND SHE HAD A VERY VEXING HEARTBURN AND MESPOT DOESNT LIKE WAITING EITHER SAID SIR JOHN JEALOUS FOR THE PRESTIGE OF HIS PROTECTOR NOT TO MENTION SWEET WILLIAM MISS SOULSBY GAVE A LITTLE SILVERY LAUGH OH BUT MY SWEET WILLIAMS SO GOOD AND KIND SHE SAID BESIDES I HAVE A FEELING QUITE A PSYCHIC FEELING MRS CUMBERBATCH THAT MR TILLY IS VERY CLOSE SO I AM SAID MR TILLY INDEED AS I WALKED HERE CONTINUED MISS SOULSBY I FELT THAT MR TILLY WAS SOMEWHERE QUITE CLOSE TO ME DEAR ME WHATS THAT MR TILLY WAS SO DELIGHTED AT BEING SENSED THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST GIVING A TREMENDOUS RAP ON THE TABLE IN A SORT OF PLEASED APPLAUSE MRS CUMBERBATCH HEARD IT TOO IM SURE THATS ABIBEL COME TO TELL US THAT HE IS READY SHE SAID I KNOW ABIBELS KNOCK A LITTLE PATIENCE ABIBEL LETS GIVE MR TILLY THREE MINUTES MORE AND THEN BEGIN PERHAPS IF WE PUT UP THE BLINDS ABIBEL WILL UNDERSTAND WE HAVENT BEGUN THIS WAS DONE AND MISS SOULSBY GLIDED TO THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO MAKE KNOWN MR TILLYS APPROACH FOR HE ALWAYS CAME ALONG THE OPPOSITE PAVEMENT AND CROSSED OVER BY THE LITTLE ISLAND IN THE RIVER OF TRAFFIC THERE WAS EVIDENTLY SOME LATELY PUBLISHED NEWS FOR THE READERS OF EARLY EDITIONS WERE BUSY AND SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ONE OF THE ADVERTISEMENT BOARDS BEARING IN LARGE LETTERS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AT HYDE PARK CORNER SHE DREW IN HER BREATH WITH A HISSING SOUND AND TURNED AWAY UNWILLING TO HAVE HER PSYCHIC TRANQUILLITY UPSET BY THE INTRUSION OF PAINFUL INCIDENTS BUT MR TILLY WHO HAD FOLLOWED HER TO THE WINDOW AND SAW WHAT SHE HAD SEEN COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN A SPIRITUAL WHOOP OF EXULTATION WHY ITS ALL ABOUT ME HE SAID SUCH LARGE LETTERS TOO VERY GRATIFYING SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS WILL NO DOUBT CONTAIN MY NAME HE GAVE ANOTHER LOUD RAP TO CALL ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AND MRS CUMBERBATCH SITTING DOWN IN HER ANTIQUE CHAIR WHICH HAD ONCE BELONGED TO MADAME BLAVATSKY AGAIN HEARD WELL IF THAT ISNT ABIBEL AGAIN SHE SAID BE QUIET NAUGHTY PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER BEGIN SHE RECITED THE USUAL INVOCATION TO GUIDES AND ANGELS AND LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO TWITCH AND MUTTER AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WITH SEVERAL LOUD SNORTS RELAPSED INTO CATALEPTIC IMMOBILITY THERE SHE LAY STIFF AS A POKER A PORT OF CALL SO TO SPEAK FOR ANY VOYAGING INTELLIGENCE WITH PLEASED ANTICIPATION MR TILLY AWAITED THEIR COMING HOW GRATIFYING IF NAPOLEON WITH WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN TALKED RECOGNISED HIM AND SAID PLEASED TO SEE YOU MR TILLY I PERCEIVE YOU HAVE JOINED US THE ROOM WAS DARK EXCEPT FOR THE RUBY SHAPED LAMP IN FRONT OF CARDINAL NEWMAN BUT TO MR TILLYS EMANCIPATED PERCEPTIONS THE WITHDRAWAL OF MERE MATERIAL LIGHT MADE NO DIFFERENCE AND HE IDLY WONDERED WHY IT WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED THAT DISEMBODIED SPIRITS LIKE HIMSELF PRODUCED THEIR MOST POWERFUL EFFECTS IN THE DARK HE COULD NOT IMAGINE THE REASON FOR THAT AND WHAT PUZZLED HIM STILL MORE THERE WAS NOT TO HIS SPIRITUAL PERCEPTION ANY SIGN OF THOSE COLLEAGUES OF HIS FOR SO HE MIGHT NOW CALL THEM WHO USUALLY ATTENDED MRS CUMBERBATCHS SÉANCES IN SUCH GRATIFYING NUMBERS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN MOANING AND MUTTERING A LONG TIME NOW MR TILLY WAS IN NO WAY CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF ABIBEL AND SWEET WILLIAM AND SAPPHIRE AND NAPOLEON THEY OUGHT TO BE HERE BY NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT WHILE HE STILL WONDERED AT THEIR ABSENCE HE SAW TO HIS AMAZED DISGUST THAT THE MEDIUMS HAND NOW COVERED WITH A BLACK GLOVE AND THUS INVISIBLE TO ORDINARY HUMAN VISION IN THE DARKNESS WAS GROPING ABOUT THE TABLE AND CLEARLY SEARCHING FOR THE MEGAPHONE TRUMPET WHICH LAY THERE HE FOUND THAT HE COULD READ HER MIND WITH THE SAME EASE THOUGH FAR LESS SATISFACTION AS HE HAD READ MISS IDAS HALF AN HOUR AGO AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS INTENDING TO APPLY THE TRUMPET TO HER OWN MOUTH AND PRETEND TO BE ABIBEL OR SEMIRAMIS OR SOMEBODY WHEREAS SHE AFFIRMED THAT SHE NEVER TOUCHED THE TRUMPET HERSELF MUCH SHOCKED AT THIS HE SNATCHED UP THE TRUMPET HIMSELF AND OBSERVED THAT SHE WAS NOT IN TRANCE AT ALL FOR SHE OPENED HER SHARP BLACK EYES WHICH ALWAYS REMINDED HIM OF BUTTONS COVERED WITH AMERICAN CLOTH AND GAVE A GREAT GASP WHY MR TILLY SHE SAID ON THE SPIRITUAL PLANE TOO THE REST OF THE CIRCLE WAS NOW SINGING LEAD KINDLY LIGHT IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE CARDINAL NEWMAN AND THIS CONVERSATION WAS CONDUCTED UNDER COVER OF THE HOARSE CROONING VOICES BUT MR TILLY HAD THE FEELING THAT THOUGH MRS CUMBERBATCH SAW AND HEARD HIM AS CLEARLY AS HE SAW HER HE WAS QUITE IMPERCEPTIBLE TO THE OTHERS YES IVE BEEN KILLED HE SAID AND I WANT TO GET INTO TOUCH WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD THATS WHY I CAME HERE BUT I WANT TO GET INTO TOUCH WITH OTHER SPIRITS TOO AND SURELY ABIBEL OR MESPOT OUGHT TO BE HERE BY THIS TIME HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER AND HER EYES FELL BEFORE HIS LIKE THOSE OF A DETECTED CHARLATAN A TERRIBLE SUSPICION INVADED HIS MIND WHAT ARE YOU A FRAUD MRS CUMBERBATCH HE ASKED OH FOR SHAME THINK OF ALL THE GUINEAS I HAVE PAID YOU YOU SHALL HAVE THEM ALL BACK SAID MRS CUMBERBATCH BUT DONT TELL OF ME SHE BEGAN TO WHIMPER AND HE REMEMBERED THAT SHE OFTEN MADE THAT SORT OF SNIFFLING NOISE WHEN ABIBEL WAS TAKING POSSESSION OF HER THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT ABIBEL IS COMING HE SAID WITH WITHERING SARCASM COME ALONG ABIBEL WERE WAITING GIVE ME THE TRUMPET WHISPERED THE MISERABLE MEDIUM OH PLEASE GIVE ME THE TRUMPET I SHALL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID MR TILLY INDIGNANTLY I WOULD SOONER USE IT MYSELF SHE GAVE A SOB OF RELIEF OH DO MR TILLY SHE SAID WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA IT WILL BE MOST INTERESTING TO EVERYBODY TO HEAR YOU TALK JUST AFTER YOUVE BEEN KILLED AND BEFORE THEY KNOW IT WOULD BE THE MAKING OF ME AND IM NOT A FRAUD AT LEAST NOT ALTOGETHER I DO HAVE SPIRITUAL PERCEPTIONS SOMETIMES SPIRITS DO COMMUNICATE THROUGH ME AND WHEN THEY WONT COME THROUGH ITS A DREADFUL TEMPTATION TO A POOR WOMAN TO TO SUPPLEMENT THEM BY HUMAN AGENCY AND HOW COULD I BE SEEING AND HEARING YOU NOW AND BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU SO PLEASANTLY IM SURE IF I HADNT SUPER NORMAL POWERS YOUVE BEEN KILLED SO YOU ASSURE ME AND YET I CAN SEE AND HEAR YOU QUITE PLAINLY WHERE DID IT HAPPEN MAY I ASK IF ITS NOT A PAINFUL SUBJECT HYDE PARK CORNER HALF AN HOUR AGO SAID MR TILLY NO IT ONLY HURT FOR A MOMENT THANKS BUT ABOUT YOUR OTHER SUGGESTION WHILE THE THIRD VERSE OF LEAD KINDLY LIGHT WAS GOING ON MR TILLY APPLIED HIS MIND TO THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF MRS CUMBERBATCH HAD NO POWER OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE UNSEEN SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN HIM BUT SHE EVIDENTLY HAD AND HAD HEARD HIM TOO FOR THEIR CONVERSATION HAD CERTAINLY BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE SPIRIT PLANE WITH PERFECT LUCIDITY NATURALLY NOW THAT HE WAS A GENUINE SPIRIT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE MIXED UP IN FRAUDULENT MEDIUMSHIP FOR HE FELT THAT SUCH A THING WOULD SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE PROBABLY IT WAS WIDELY KNOWN THAT MRS CUMBERBATCH WAS A PERSON TO BE AVOIDED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING SO SOON FOUND A MEDIUM THROUGH WHOM HE COULD COMMUNICATE WITH HIS FRIENDS IT WAS HARD TO TAKE A HIGH MORAL VIEW AND SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH HER I DONT KNOW IF I TRUST YOU HE SAID I SHOULDNT HAVE A MOMENTS PEACE IF I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE SENDING ALL SORTS OF BOGUS MESSAGES FROM ME TO THE CIRCLE WHICH I WASNT RESPONSIBLE FOR AT ALL YOUVE DONE IT WITH ABIBEL AND MESPOT HOW CAN I KNOW THAT WHEN I DONT CHOOSE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH YOU YOU WONT MAKE UP ALL SORTS OF PIFFLE ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT SHE POSITIVELY SQUIRMED IN HER CHAIR OH ILL TURN OVER A NEW LEAF SHE SAID I WILL LEAVE ALL THAT SORT OF THING BEHIND ME AND I AM A MEDIUM LOOK AT ME ARENT I MORE REAL TO YOU THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS DONT I BELONG TO YOUR PLANE IN A WAY THAT NONE OF THE OTHERS DO I MAY BE OCCASIONALLY FRAUDULENT AND I CAN NO MORE GET NAPOLEON HERE THAN I CAN FLY BUT IM GENUINE AS WELL OH MR TILLY BE INDULGENT TO US POOR HUMAN CREATURES IT ISNT SO LONG SINCE YOU WERE ONE OF US YOURSELF THE MENTION OF NAPOLEON WITH THE INFORMATION THAT MRS CUMBERBATCH HAD NEVER BEEN CONTROLLED BY THAT GREAT CREATURE WOUNDED MR TILLY AGAIN OFTEN IN THIS DARKENED ROOM HE HAD HELD LONG COLLOQUIES WITH HIM AND NAPOLEON HAD GIVEN HIM MOST INTERESTING DETAILS OF HIS LIFE ON ST HELENA WHICH SO MR TILLY HAD FOUND WERE OFTEN BORNE OUT BY LORD ROSEBERYS PLEASANT VOLUME THE LAST PHASE BUT NOW THE WHOLE THING WORE A MORE SINISTER ASPECT AND SUSPICION AS SOLID AS CERTAINTY BUMPED AGAINST HIS MIND CONFESS HE SAID WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THAT NAPOLEON TALK FROM YOU TOLD US YOU HAD NEVER READ LORD ROSEBERYS BOOK AND ALLOWED US TO LOOK THROUGH YOUR LIBRARY TO SEE THAT IT WASNT THERE BE HONEST FOR ONCE MRS CUMBERBATCH SHE SUPPRESSED A SOB I WILL SHE SAID THE BOOK WAS THERE ALL THE TIME I PUT IT INTO AN OLD COVER CALLED ELEGANT EXTRACTS BUT IM NOT WHOLLY A FRAUD WERE TALKING TOGETHER YOU A SPIRIT AND I A MORTAL FEMALE THEY CANT HEAR US TALK BUT ONLY LOOK AT ME AND YOULL SEE YOU CAN TALK TO THEM THROUGH ME IF YOULL ONLY BE SO KIND I DONT OFTEN GET IN TOUCH WITH A GENUINE SPIRIT LIKE YOURSELF MR TILLY GLANCED AT THE OTHER SITTERS AND THEN BACK TO THE MEDIUM WHO TO KEEP THE OTHERS INTERESTED WAS MAKING WEIRD GURGLING NOISES LIKE AN UNDERVITALISED SIPHON CERTAINLY SHE WAS FAR CLEARER TO HIM THAN WERE THE OTHERS AND HER ARGUMENT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE AND HEAR HIM HAD GREAT WEIGHT AND THEN A NEW AND CURIOUS PERCEPTION CAME TO HIM HER MIND SEEMED SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM LIKE A POOL OF SLIGHTLY MUDDY WATER AND HE FIGURED HIMSELF AS STANDING ON A HEADER BOARD ABOVE IT PERFECTLY ABLE IF HE CHOSE TO IMMERSE HIMSELF IN IT THE OBJECTION TO DOING SO WAS ITS MUDDINESS ITS MATERIALITY THE REASON FOR DOING SO WAS THAT HE FELT THAT THEN HE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE HEARD BY THE OTHERS POSSIBLY TO BE SEEN BY THEM CERTAINLY TO COME INTO TOUCH WITH THEM AS IT WAS THE LOUDEST BANGS ON THE TABLE WERE ONLY FAINTLY PERCEPTIBLE IM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HE SAID OH MR TILLY JUST JUMP IN LIKE A KIND GOOD SPIRIT SHE SAID MAKE YOUR OWN TEST CONDITIONS PUT YOUR HAND OVER MY MOUTH TO MAKE SURE THAT IM NOT SPEAKING AND KEEP HOLD OF THE TRUMPET AND YOULL PROMISE NOT TO CHEAT ANY MORE HE ASKED NEVER HE MADE UP HIS MIND ALL RIGHT THEN HE SAID AND SO TO SPEAK DIVED INTO HER MIND HE EXPERIENCED THE ODDEST SENSATION IT WAS LIKE PASSING OUT OF SOME FINE SUNNY AIR INTO THE STUFFIEST OF UNVENTILATED ROOMS SPACE AND TIME CLOSED OVER HIM AGAIN HIS HEAD SWAM HIS EYES WERE HEAVY THEN WITH THE TRUMPET IN ONE HAND HE LAID THE OTHER FIRMLY OVER HER MOUTH LOOKING ROUND HE SAW THAT THE ROOM SEEMED ALMOST COMPLETELY DARK BUT THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE FIGURES SITTING ROUND THE TABLE HAD VASTLY GAINED IN SOLIDITY HERE I AM HE SAID BRISKLY MISS SOULSBY GAVE A STARTLED EXCLAMATION THATS MR TILLYS VOICE SHE WHISPERED WHY OF COURSE IT IS SAID MR TILLY IVE JUST PASSED OVER AT HYDE PARK CORNER UNDER A TRACTION ENGINE HE FELT THE DEAD WEIGHT OF THE MEDIUMS MIND HER CONVENTIONAL CONCEPTIONS HER MILD UNREAL PIETY PRESSING IN ON HIM FROM ALL SIDES STIFLING AND CONFUSING HIM WHATEVER HE SAID HAD TO PASS THROUGH MUDDY WATER THERES A WONDERFUL FEELING OF JOY AND LIGHTNESS HE SAID I CANT TELL YOU OF THE SUNSHINE AND HAPPINESS WERE ALL VERY BUSY AND ACTIVE HELPING OTHERS AND ITS SUCH A PLEASURE DEAR FRIENDS TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO TOUCH WITH YOU ALL AGAIN DEATH IS NOT DEATH IT IS THE GATE OF LIFE HE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY OH I CANT STAND THIS HE SAID TO THE MEDIUM YOU MAKE ME TALK SUCH TWADDLE DO GET YOUR STUPID MIND OUT OF THE WAY CANT WE DO ANYTHING IN WHICH YOU WONT INTERFERE WITH ME SO MUCH CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SPIRIT LIGHTS ROUND THE ROOM SUGGESTED MRS CUMBERBATCH IN A SLEEPY VOICE YOU HAVE COME THROUGH BEAUTIFULLY MR TILLY ITS TOO DEAR OF YOU YOURE SURE YOU HAVENT ARRANGED SOME PHOSPHORESCENT PATCHES ALREADY ASKED MR TILLY SUSPICIOUSLY YES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO NEAR THE CHIMNEY PIECE SAID MRS CUMBERBATCH BUT NONE ANYWHERE ELSE DEAR MR TILLY I SWEAR THERE ARE NOT JUST GIVE US A NICE STAR WITH LONG RAYS ON THE CEILING MR TILLY WAS THE MOST GOOD NATURED OF MEN ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP AN UNATTRACTIVE FEMALE IN DISTRESS AND WHISPERING TO HER I SHALL REQUIRE THE PHOSPHORESCENT PATCHES TO BE GIVEN INTO MY HANDS AFTER THE SÉANCE HE PROCEEDED BY THE MERE EFFORT OF HIS IMAGINATION TO LIGHT A BEAUTIFUL BIG STAR WITH RED AND VIOLET RAYS ON THE CEILING OF COURSE IT WAS NOT NEARLY AS BRILLIANT AS HIS OWN CONCEPTION OF IT FOR ITS LIGHT HAD TO PASS THROUGH THE OPACITY OF THE MEDIUMS MIND BUT IT WAS STILL A MOST STRIKING OBJECT AND ELICITED GASPS OF APPLAUSE FROM THE COMPANY TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT OF IT HE INTONED A FEW VERY PRETTY LINES ABOUT A STAR BY ADELAIDE ANNE PROCTER WHOSE POEMS HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM TO EMANATE FROM THE TOPMOST PEAK OF PARNASSUS OH THANK YOU MR TILLY WHISPERED THE MEDIUM IT WAS LOVELY WOULD A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT BE PERMITTED ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO REPRODUCE IT AGAIN OH I DONT KNOW SAID MR TILLY IRRITABLY I WANT TO GET OUT IM VERY HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND ITS ALL SO CHEAP CHEAP EJACULATED MRS CUMBERBATCH WHY THERES NOT A MEDIUM IN LONDON WHOSE FUTURE WOULDNT BE MADE BY A REAL GENUINE STAR LIKE THAT SAY TWICE A WEEK BUT I WASNT RUN OVER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT MAKE THE FORTUNE OF MEDIUMS SAID MR TILLY I WANT TO GO ITS ALL RATHER DEGRADING AND I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING OF MY NEW WORLD I DONT KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE YET OH BUT MR TILLY SHE SAID YOU TOLD US LOVELY THINGS ABOUT IT HOW BUSY AND HAPPY YOU WERE NO I DIDNT IT WAS YOU WHO SAID THAT AT LEAST IT WAS YOU WHO PUT IT INTO MY HEAD EVEN AS HE WISHED HE FOUND HIMSELF EMERGING FROM THE DULL WATERS OF MRS CUMBERBATCHS MIND THERES THE WHOLE NEW WORLD WAITING FOR ME HE SAID I MUST GO AND SEE IT ILL COME BACK AND TELL YOU FOR IT MUST BE FULL OF MARVELLOUS REVELATIONS SUDDENLY HE FELT THE HOPELESSNESS OF IT THERE WAS THAT THICK FLUID OF MATERIALITY TO PIERCE AND AS IT DRIPPED OFF HIM AGAIN HE BEGAN TO SEE THAT NOTHING OF THAT FINE RARE QUALITY OF LIFE WHICH HE HAD JUST BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE COULD PENETRATE THESE OPACITIES THAT WAS WHY PERHAPS ALL THAT THUS CAME ACROSS FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD WAS SO STUPID SO BANAL THEY OF WHOM HE NOW WAS ONE COULD TAP ON FURNITURE COULD LIGHT STARS COULD ABOUND WITH COMMONPLACE COULD READ AS IN A BOOK THE MIND OF MEDIUM OR SITTERS BUT NOTHING MORE THEY HAD TO PASS INTO THE REGION OF GROSS PERCEPTIONS IN ORDER TO BE SEEN OF BLIND EYES AND BE HEARD OF DEAF EARS MRS CUMBERBATCH STIRRED THE POWER IS FAILING SHE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE WHICH MR TILLY FELT WAS MEANT TO IMITATE HIS OWN I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW DEAR FRIENDS HE FELT MUCH EXASPERATED THE POWER ISNT FAILING HE SHOUTED IT WASNT I WHO SAID THAT BESIDES I HAVE GOT TO SEE IF ITS TRUE GOOD BYE DONT CHEAT ANY MORE HE DROPPED HIS CARD OF ADMITTANCE TO THE SEANCE ON THE TABLE AND HEARD MURMURS OF EXCITEMENT AS HE FLOATED OFF THE NEWS OF THE WONDERFUL STAR AND THE PRESENCE OF MR TILLY AT THE SÉANCE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OF HIS DEATH WHICH AT THE TIME WAS UNKNOWN TO ANY OF THE SITTERS SPREAD SWIFTLY THROUGH SPIRITUALISTIC CIRCLES THE PSYCHICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY SENT INVESTIGATORS TO TAKE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE FROM ALL THOSE PRESENT BUT WERE INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE THE OCCURRENCE TO A SUBTLE MIXTURE OF THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE AND UNCONSCIOUS VISUAL IMPRESSION WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MISS SOULSBY HAD A FEW MINUTES PREVIOUSLY SEEN A NEWS BROAD IN THE STREET OUTSIDE RECORDING THE ACCIDENT AT HYDE PARK CORNER THIS EXPLANATION WAS RATHER ELABORATE FOR IT POSTULATED THAT MISS SOULSBY THINKING OF MR TILLYS NON ARRIVAL HAD COMBINED THAT WITH THE ACCIDENT AT HYDE PARK CORNER AND HAD PROBABLY THOUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY SEEN THE NAME OF THE VICTIM ON ANOTHER NEWS BROAD AND HAD TRANSFERRED THE WHOLE BY TELEPATHY TO THE MIND OF THE MEDIUM AS FOR THE STAR ON THE CEILING THOUGH THEY COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR IT THEY CERTAINLY FOUND REMAINS OF PHOSPHORESCENT PAINT ON THE PANELS OF THE WALL ABOVE THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STAR HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY SOME SIMILAR CONTRIVANCE SO THEY REJECTED THE WHOLE THING WHICH WAS A PITY SINCE FOR ONCE THE PHENOMENA WERE ABSOLUTELY GENUINE MISS SOULSBY CONTINUED TO BE A CONSTANT ATTENDANT AT MRS CUMBERBATCHS SÉANCES BUT NEVER EXPERIENCED THE PRESENCE OF MR TILLY AGAIN ON THAT THE READER MAY PUT
